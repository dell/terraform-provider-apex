## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Mobility group name
- `system_id` (String) Identifier of the system for the mobility group members
- `system_type` (String) The source system type (e.g.: POWERFLEX)
- `volume_id` (List of String) List of volume ids you want to add to the group

### Optional

- `description` (String) Mobility group description
- `id` (String) Mobility group identifier
- `powerflex` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--powerflex))

### Read-Only

- `creation_timestamp` (String) When the mobility group was created
- `members` (Attributes List) A mobility member is an object (e.g. volume) that is part of a mobility group that will be the source of mobility copy operations. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--members))

<a id="nestedblock--powerflex"></a>
### Nested Schema for `powerflex`

Required:

- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password of the powerflex
- `username` (String) Username of the powerflex

Optional:

- `host` (String) Host, ip or hostname of the powerflex. If left empty we will attempt to get the ip through Apex from the ID
- `insecure` (Boolean) Validated the certificate when connecting to the powerflex, defaults if unset to true
- `scheme` (String) Scheme of the powerflex, defaults if unset to https


<a id="nestedatt--members"></a>
### Nested Schema for `members`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) Identifier of the member (e.g. PowerFlex volume identifier)
- `name` (String) Name of the member (e.g. name of the volume)
- `size` (String) Size of the member (e.g. volume size in bytes)

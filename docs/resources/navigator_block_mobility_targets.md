## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the mobility target
- `source_mobility_group_id` (String) ID of the source mobility group
- `system_id` (String) ID of the target system
- `system_type` (String) The source system type (e.g.: POWERFLEX)
- `target_system_options` (String) Storage pool id to use for allocating target volumes

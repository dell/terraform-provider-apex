## Schema

### Required

- `mobility_target_id` (String) Target ID
- `system_id` (String)

### Optional

- `description` (String) Description of the clone
- `host_mappings` (Attributes List) This represents the mapping of a repurposed (clone) storage object to a host (presumably using the clone for some analytical workload) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--host_mappings))
- `id` (String) The ID of the clone
- `name` (String) Name of the clone
- `powerflex` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--powerflex))

### Read-Only

- `clone_volumes` (Attributes List) A clone mobility member provides details of clone volume (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--clone_volumes))
- `creation_timestamp` (String) When the clone was created
- `image_timestamp` (String) Image timestamp
- `refresh_timestamp` (String) When the clone was last updated

<a id="nestedatt--host_mappings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `host_mappings`

Required:

- `host_id` (String) Identifier of the host

Read-Only:

- `host_initiator_protocol` (String) Type of the host
- `host_ip` (String) IP address of host
- `host_name` (String) Name of host/SDC to be mapped to the clone
- `id` (String) This is a host mappings id generated by APEX Navigator for Multicloud Storage
- `nqn` (String) NVMe qualified name. Only applicable if host_initiator_protocol is NVMe


<a id="nestedblock--powerflex"></a>
### Nested Schema for `powerflex`

Required:

- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password of the powerflex
- `username` (String) Username of the powerflex

Optional:

- `host` (String) Host, ip or hostname of the powerflex. If left empty we will attempt to get the ip through Apex from the ID
- `insecure` (Boolean) Validated the certificate when connecting to the powerflex, defaults if unset to true
- `scheme` (String) Scheme of the powerflex, defaults if unset to https


<a id="nestedatt--clone_volumes"></a>
### Nested Schema for `clone_volumes`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) ID of the member
- `name` (String) Name of the member

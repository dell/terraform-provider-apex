// JobStateEnum : Current status of the job. * SCHEDULED - Waiting for start time. * QUEUED - Job is ready to run but waiting because too many other jobs are already running. * RUNNING - Job is in progress. * PAUSING - Job is attempting to pause. * PAUSED - Job is paused. * RESUMING - Job is attempting to resume. * CANCELLING - Job is attempting to cancel. * CANCELLED - Job is cancelled. * SUCCEEDED - Job has successfully completed. Status must be 200, 201, or 204. * COMPLETED_WITH_MESSAGES - Job has completed, but with only partial success. The status will be 299, and the   response body will be the standard ErrorResponse, extended as necessary fo any other response data    (such as the created instance in the case of a create operation in COMPLETED_WITH_MESSAGES state). * FAILED - Job has failed, and rolled back any configuration changes if possible. Status will be 4xx or 5xx.
